					EARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness. The alarm clock is ringing. It says <span>3:20</span>, and the moonlight streaming through the window means it must be the early morning. Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost knocking it over in the process. Incandescent light fills the room, painting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread, too. He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles above him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling. He reads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around him.

					It is a bare room. Institutional, maybe. There is a desk over by the window. The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock. Earl probably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed. He even has his shoes on under the sheets. He extracts himself from the bed and crosses to the desk. Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone lived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here and there to the wall. No pictures, no books, nothing. Through the window, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass.

					Earl slaps the <span>snooze button on the alarm clock</span> and stares a moment at the <span>two keys taped to the back of his hand.</span> He picks at the tape while he searches through the empty drawers. In the left pocket of his jacket, he finds a roll of hundred&#45;dollar bills and a <span>letter sealed in an envelope.</span> He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom. Bits of tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else.

					Earl absentmindedly plays with the <span>lump of scar tissue on his neck</span> and moves back toward the bed. He lies back down and stares up at the ceiling and the sign taped to it. The sign reads, <span><a class="split" href="#">GET UP, GET OUT RIGHT NOW.</a></span> THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU.

					Earl closes his eyes.
